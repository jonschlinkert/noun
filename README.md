# noun [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/noun.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/noun)

> `.use()` plugins to manipulate objects. Easy to use and extend. Load locally defined plugins, or define a namespace to automatically load plugins from load modules.

Noun makes it easy to extend your application with basic plugin functionality.


## Usage

```js
var Noun = require('noun');
```

By default, plugins named `noun-*` are automatically loaded from `node_modules`. Pass a `namespace` to
use your own naming convention:

```js
// load plugins named `my-app-*`
var noun = new Noun('my-app');
```

_**Note** that plugins are only loaded if they are listed in `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in package.json._

See the [examples](./example.js) and [tests](./test) for a better understanding of how Noun works.


## Install
#### Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i noun --save
```

## Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

## API
### [Noun](index.js#L25)

Create an instance of `Noun` using the given `namespace`.

* `options` **{Object}**    

```js
var Noun = require('noun');
var noun = new Noun('foo');
```

### [.plugin](index.js#L48)

Define a Noun plugin.

* `fn` **{Function}**: The function to call.    
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns `Noun` for chaining.  

```js
noun
  .plugin(foo())
  .plugin(bar())
  .plugin(baz())
```

### [.loadPlugins](index.js#L71)

Called in the constructor to load plugins from `node_modules` using the given `namespace`. For example, the namespace `foo` will load plugins from the `foo-*` glob pattern.

* `pattern` **{String}**: Optionally pass a glob pattern when calling the method directly.    
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns an object of plugins loaded from `node_modules`.  

You may also call the `.loadPlugins()` method directly.

```js
noun.loadPlugins('baz-*');
```

### [.run](index.js#L103)

Run an object of plugins. By default, the `.run()` method is called in the constructor, but it may also be used directly.

* `fns` **{Object}**: Object of plugins.    

When used directly, each plugin is a key-value pair, where the
key is the plugin name, and the value is the function to be called.

Currently, the plugin name is useless, so this could have
been setup to take an array. However, there are plans to
add additional features to take advantage of this configuration.

**Example:**

```js
noun.run({'myPlugin': [function]});
```
