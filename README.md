# noun [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/noun.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/noun)

> Load and use plugins to manipulate objects. Load locally defined plugins, or define a namespace to automatically load plugins from node_modules. Easy to use and extend.

Noun makes it easy to extend your application with basic plugin functionality.


## Usage

```js
var Noun = require('noun');
```

### npm plugins

By default, plugins named `noun-*` are automatically loaded from `node_modules`.

Pass a `namespace` to use your own naming convention:

```js
// load plugins named `my-app-*`
var noun = new Noun('my-app');
```

_**Note** that plugins are only loaded if they are listed in `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in package.json._

See the [examples](./example.js) and [tests](./test) for a better understanding of how Noun works.

### local plugins

For local plugins, simply use a leading dot `./` in the path, just like `require()` rules:

```js
noun.loadPlugins('./plugins/*.js');
```

## Install
#### Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i noun --save
```

## Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

## API
### [Noun](index.js#L26)

Create an instance of `Noun` with the given `namespace`.

* `namespace` **{Object}**: Used to automatically load plugins from node_modules.    
* `source` **{Object}**: Pass an object to directly extend the `this` object.    

```js
var Noun = require('noun');
var noun = new Noun('foo');
```

### [.plugin](index.js#L49)

Define a plugin.

* `fn` **{Function}**: The function to call.    
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns `Noun` for chaining.  

```js
noun
  .plugin(foo())
  .plugin(bar())
  .plugin(baz())
```

### [.loadPlugins](index.js#L75)

Load plugins.

* `pattern` **{String}**: Optionally pass a glob pattern when calling the method directly.    
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns an object of plugins loaded from `node_modules`.  

Called in the constructor to load plugins from `node_modules`
using the given `namespace`, but you may also call the method
directly.

For example, the namespace `foo` would load plugins using the
`foo-*` glob pattern, e.g:

```js
noun.loadPlugins('foo-*');
```

### [.runPlugins](index.js#L107)

Run an object of plugins. By default, the `.runPlugins()` method is called in the constructor, but it may also be used directly.

* `fns` **{Object}**: Object of plugins.    

When used directly, each plugin is a key-value pair, where the
key is the plugin name, and the value is the function to be called.

Currently, the plugin name is useless, so this could have
been setup to take an array. However, there are plans to
add additional features to take advantage of this configuration.

**Example:**

```js
noun.runPlugins({'myPlugin': [function]});
```
